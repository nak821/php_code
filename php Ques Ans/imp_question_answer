=============================================
1. Query for find nth maximum salary.

ANS:- SELECT *
FROM table_name AS a 
WHERE n - 1 = (
 SELECT COUNT(primary_key_column) 
 FROM products b 
 WHERE  b.column_name > a. column_name)

 Ex : select * from salary as a where 2 - 1 = (select count(id) from salary as b where b.salay_amt > a.salary_amt)

 ==============================================
2. Query for search value in comma seperated rows

ANS:- select find_in_set('a','a,b,c,d')
==============================================
3. Query for copy one table structure to another in mysql 
ANS:- INSERT INTO city_new (id, name) SELECT population, countrycode FROM city

4. Query for copy data from one table to anothe table.

ANS:- INSERT INTO new_table SELECT * FROM old_table
		or
	INSERT INTO  city_new (id, name) SELECT population, countrycode FROM city


5. Optimize queries based on the query optimization guidelines

ANS: - 1. Index all the predicates in JOIN, WHERE, ORDER BY and GROUP BY clauses.
       2.Avoid using functions in predicates(columns).
       3. Avoid using wildcard (%) at the beginning of a predicate.(SELECT * FROM TABLE1 WHERE COL1 LIKE '%ABC').
       4. Avoid unnecessary columns in SELECT clause.
       5. Use inner join, instead of outer join if possible.
            The outer join should only be used if it is necessary. Using outer join limits the database optimization options which typically results in slower SQL execution.
       6.DISTINCT and UNION should be used only if it is necessary.
            DISTINCT and UNION operators cause sorting, which slows down the SQL execution. Use UNION ALL instead of UNION, if possible, as it is much more efficient.
